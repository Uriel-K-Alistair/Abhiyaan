The name of the package used is beginner_tutorials. (xD)
The launch file will launch 3 nodes, talker, listener and reverser.

Talker publishes "Team abhiyaan rocks" to /team_abhiyaan
Reverser subscribes to /team_abhiyaan, reverses the individual words and publishes to /naayihba_maet

Neither of these print anything to the console.

Listen just subscribes to /team_abhiyaan and prints the feed.

All topic feeds can be checked using echo.
