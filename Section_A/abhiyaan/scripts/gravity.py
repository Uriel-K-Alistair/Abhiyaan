    # I want to tell it, this is your new velocity. However, we cannot make the turtle instantaneously rotate its head to face the direction of the new velocity.
    # So, if we want absolute perfection, we can freeze the simulation of gravity for dt, 
    # just stuff a linearv=0, angularv=delta theta/dt, and then feed the updated velocity as linear with angular 0.
    # If we just stuff linear and angular together, the angle the turtle should face now, will be faced in time dt. 
    # That is, the angular velocity lags behind the linear velocity by time dt. 
    # I am lazy, and dt is small. Ignore the lag.
