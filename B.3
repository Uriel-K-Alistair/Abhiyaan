2)3D LIDAR Point Cloud based Intersection Recognition for Autonomous Driving

• The input that we are taking is from a LIDAR scanner. Using light reflection, it gives us the closest reflecting surface at every angle.
This will give us a 3D point cloud of data, where we can imagine we keep a dot at every point that has an object.
• We look at the Bird's eye 2D view of this data, and draw a grid to aid us, with the smallest squares being of some dimesion r x r.
• Each square is now a thin cuboid of data, with dots in places where stuff exists. We take the variance of the heights of these data points.
If the variance crosses a certain threshold, we flag the grid cell as 1 (meaning "stuff is here.") If its low variance data, we flag it as 0.

Quick Remark:
If there is some planar object, or even somewhat flat obstacle, say, a large metal sheet sticking out of a truck, that is NOT getting detected.
Keep in mind that the real objective here is to detect intersections, so this won't be an issue. 
The walls, buidings, trees or whatever it is that bounds the roads, WILL get detected, and when we filter out the pedestrians and vehicles, we can happily detect the intersections.

Important notice: We are relying on the fact that there is STUFF bounding the roads. If the roads are in a totally flat area, with little surrounding terrain,
since the algorithm doesnt look AT the road, like a normal human, its going to face total failure.
