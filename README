Previous Experience:

Being a freshie, I have not done much that was a REAL thing, like project abhiyaan.

Second in Techsoc Machine Learning (Team of 2)
Second in Techsoc Competitive Programming (Team of 2)

My experience with programming has only been casual.
I have worked a lot with base python, am familiar with the basics of c++, and have a somewhat trivial level of knowledge in other areas.

Current PORs:

Class Rep. (Lite only, 43 ppl batch with 3 CRs)

Why I want to work in the team:

Simply put, lim t--> ∞ (my awesomeness) =  ∞, and since I think you people are really awesome, I'd be a great addition.

Okay, more seriously,
 I want to gain experience, knowledge and skill. Working on this will give me exponential growth.
 I want to do something I enjoy and find meaningful.
 And I want to look cool while im at it :)

Relevant courses:

I did python in 11th and 12th as my CS syllabus.
I did a 2 week course at infosys when I was in class 9, which taught me apart from coding, how to work in larger projects and lots of life skills material reg worklife. 

I am doing a BSc. in Programming and Data Science, offered as an online degree, from IITM.
I have a foundational certificate, and I'm just starting on the Diploma level courses.
This means I have a pretty strong foundation in principles of statistics and computer science.

I am halfway though Andrew NG's Machine learning course on coursera. 
(The rest will probably be done post the train wreck that is the trimester system.)

Other Relevant things:

I have truckloads of enthu.
Enough to rapidly familiarise myself with any new thing, and solve problems using that.
(You made me install Ubuntu,do ROS, AND OpenCV in 4 days, in the middle of tamil new year.)

Did I attempt the bonus Questions?

(I'll update this later. In case I forget, super sorry, it may be there in the folder)
